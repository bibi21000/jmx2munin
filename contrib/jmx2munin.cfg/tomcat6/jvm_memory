java_lang_memory_nonheapmemoryusage_committed.label non-heap committed
java_lang_memory_nonheapmemoryusage_committed.info Current memory allocated outside the heap. This amount of memory is guaranteed for the Java virtual machine to use.

java_lang_memory_nonheapmemoryusage_used.label non-heap used
java_lang_memory_nonheapmemoryusage_used.info Current memory usage outside the heap.

java_lang_memory_nonheapmemoryusage_max.label non-heap max
java_lang_memory_nonheapmemoryusage_max.info Maximum amount of non-heap memory that can be used for memory management. This amount of memory is not guaranteed to be available if it is greater than the amount of committed memory. The Java virtual machine may fail to allocate memory even if the amount of used memory does not exceed this maximum size.

java_lang_memory_heapmemoryusage_committed.label heap committed
java_lang_memory_heapmemoryusage_committed.info Current heap memory allocated. This amount of memory is guaranteed for the Java virtual machine to use.

java_lang_memory_heapmemoryusage_used.label heap used
java_lang_memory_heapmemoryusage_used.info Current heap memory usage.

java_lang_memory_heapmemoryusage_max.label heap max
java_lang_memory_heapmemoryusage_max.info Maximum amount of heap that can be used for memory management. This amount of memory is not guaranteed to be available if it is greater than the amount of committed memory. The Java virtual machine may fail to allocate memory even if the amount of used memory does not exceed this maximum size.
